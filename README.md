 Vala Guide
</h1>

#### A guide covering the Vala programming language including the applications and tools that will make you a better and more efficient Vala developer.

## Resources

[Vala](https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/Vala) is a programming language that aims to bring modern programming language features to [GNOME](https://www.gnome.org/) developers by using the GObject type system and having additional code generation routines that make targeting the GNOME stack simple. Vala does all this without imposing any additional runtime requirements and without using a different ABI compared to applications and libraries written in C.
