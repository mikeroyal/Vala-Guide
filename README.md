 Vala Guide
</h1>

#### A guide covering the Vala programming language including the applications and tools that will make you a better and more efficient Vala developer.

## Resources

[Vala](https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/Vala) is a programming language that aims to bring modern programming language features to [GNOME](https://www.gnome.org/) developers by using the GObject type system and having additional code generation routines that make targeting the GNOME stack simple. Vala does all this without imposing any additional runtime requirements and without using a different ABI compared to applications and libraries written in C.

## Tools

[Valac](https://valalang.com/) is a Vala compiler that compiles the Vala program in C and uses the C compiler to create a binary file.

[Gnome Builder](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/GNOME_Builder) is an open-source IDE that is written in C and built using the GTK+ toolkit. It has support for the following programming languages: C, C++, Python, Rust and Vala.

[vala-vscode](https://github.com/prince781/vala-vscode) is an extension that provides Vala and Genie integration for Visual Studio such as Syntax highlighting and code intelligence.

[Sequeler](https://github.com/Alecaddd/sequeler) is a native Linux SQL client built in Vala and Gtk. It allows you to connect to your local and remote databases, write SQL in a handy text editor with language recognition, and visualize SELECT results in a Gtk.Grid Widget.

[Code](https://github.com/elementary/code) is a fast and lightweight code editor designed for elementary OS.

[Granite](https://github.com/elementary/granite) is a companion library for GTK+ and GLib. Also, it provides complex widgets and convenience functions designed for use in apps built for elementary OS.

[GameHub](https://github.com/tkashkin/GameHub) is a unified library for all your games. It allows users to store all their games from different platforms(Windows, macOS, and Linux) into one program.
